			It has recently been discovered that acient neanderthals still use outlook email.
			Despite decades of improvement of software and security, the joint society of human improvement and resources have
			decided to remove all other emails in favour of outlook provided that:
			<ol>
				<li>outlook is equiped with a <strong>further 10 passwords</strong> needed per user</li>
				<li><em>secret code and serial key per email message</strong> including a <strong>list of your previous employers and their verified phone number</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			Therefore we produly support our outlook email address which we can no longer access.
