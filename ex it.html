		If you were tasked to help someone draw a shape that they want and the only thing you could
		do is speak in numbers, how would you communicate?
		<br>
		Should you tell them the angles of the different sides of the square? Should you tell them the
		radius of the circle? How would they know what each number is for?
		Then what about size and color of the object? And.. and more.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a very convinient way of doing this, the most easiest way. 
		<br>
		to tell the other person the points he must draw, but wait. 
		What about how big the shape should be? What if he isn't drawing on a A4 but A5 paper?
		We solve this issue by telling them the percentages of the paper that our shape takes up,
		in other words the relative possitons of each of the points
		But there is yet another issue, we are producing a square from the top of the page so lets make its center the middle
		we do this to remind ourselves where the center is.

	<h2> Assumptions, assumptions. </h2>
	<p>
		Now that we have defined how we will describe our shape we can start to actualy describe it.
		lets take a look:
